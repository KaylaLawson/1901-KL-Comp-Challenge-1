## Mod1: Static comp-1 project. 

The goals were to recreate a static comp that was given to us.  We were able to apply our creative twists and pick a topic that did not have to relate to the comp given. 

I love puzzles so I went with that and came up with what you see. 

We were supposed to make the site responsive. I have added a few responsive elements to the page using Media Queries. 

Its a very clunky adaptive layout with a not so decent mobile layout applied for and iPhone width of 320px. It gets really wonky from 330px in the header.

I feel the static comp portion of the site met at least 90% of the requirements. The responsive aspect of the project, I feel met 60%. 

As I stated above, I have a lot of improvement to make on media queries and applying them, as well organizing my code to make things easier.
